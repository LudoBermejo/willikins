*Note: This is a custom npm for TheMotion. Of course you can use it by yourself, but I'm afraid you will need to change it. If you want to use it, just tell me and I can help you with th integration.*


This is a pretty little bot I want to use to easy our support department. It's based on wonderful post: http://blog.templeton.host/self-training-nlp-enabled-slack-bot-tutorial/ but with some enhandments.

It knows more or less what we are looking for, and it has a nasty dictionary to support clients 
(yeah I know, but I need to understand how it works before doing it better).
 
## How to use it
  
Just /invite willikins and ask him for results, videos, errors, finished batches for specific clients.
  
## Who is Willikins?

It's a Discworld character!!
